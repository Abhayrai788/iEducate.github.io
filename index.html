            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and
            habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education
            frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take
            place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or
            acts may be considered educational.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of higher learning in India from possibly 8th
            century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living
            there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built
            lecture halls in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda
            was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
            Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical education, e.g.
            medicine. The important urban centers of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar) and Manassa in Nagpur, among others. These
            institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as
            Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc. Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers,
            associated with founding of Mauryan Empire.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Government of India in collaboration with Ministry of Electronics &
            Information Technology has also launched a National Scholarship Portal to provide students of India access to National
            and State Level Scholarships provided by various government authorities.The National Scholarship continues to enlist scholarship programs managed by AICTE (All India Council for Technical
            Education), UGC (University Grants Commission) and respective state governments.
              </p> 
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">In the Indian education system, a teacher's success is loosely defined. It is either based on a student's success or
            based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher's skill set or
            competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they
            teach or their seniority, both of which are often not an indicator of a good teacher. And we hope ,a team learn together will grow together...  </p>
